## Terminal
- List item
On Mac OS X - the following keyboard shortcuts work by default. Note that you have to make Option key act like Meta in Terminal preferences (under keyboard tab)

- alt (⌥)+F to jump Forward by a word
- alt (⌥)+B to jump Backward by a word
I have observed that default emacs key-bindings for simple text navigation seem to work on bash shells. You can use

- alt (⌥)+D to delete a word starting from the current cursor position
- ctrl+A to jump to start of the line
- ctrl+E to jump to end of the line
- ctrl+K to kill the line starting from the cursor position
- ctrl+Y to paste text from the kill buffer
- ctrl+R to reverse search for commands you typed in the past from your history
- ctrl+S to forward search (works in zsh for me but not bash)
- ctrl+F to move forward by a char
- ctrl+B to move backward by a char
- ctrl+W to remove the word backwards from cursor position

## Paste and Match Style
⌥ + ⇧ + ⌘ + v

## Lookup a word
⌃ + ⌘ + D

## Hide Active Windows
⌘H

## Help Window
⇧ + ⌃ + ?

## Assign app to space
Ctrl + Click on Icon

## Fuzzy search in terminal
fzf

## Switch to space
Preference > Keyboard > ShortCuts
⌃ #
